<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Power Transformers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Dry-Type Transformer</li><li>Oil-Immersed Transformer</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Power transformers are crucial components of electrical networks that are responsible for transferring electricity from one voltage level to another. There are two main types of power transformers: dry-type transformers and oil-immersed transformers. </p><p>Dry-type transformers use solid insulation materials, such as epoxy resin, to insulate the windings and core of the transformer. They are often used in indoor settings where the risk of fire is a concern. </p><p>On the other hand, oil-immersed transformers immerse the windings and core in a special type of insulating oil, which helps cool down the transformer and insulate its components effectively. These transformers are commonly used in outdoor settings, such as substations and power plants.</p></p>

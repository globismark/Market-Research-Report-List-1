<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Semiconductor Chuck Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Electrostatic Chuck</li><li>Vacuum Chuck</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The semiconductor chuck market encompasses two main types: electrostatic chuck and vacuum chuck. Electrostatic chucks utilize the attractive force between a chuck and a wafer to hold the wafer in place during semiconductor processing. They employ a voltage difference to generate electrostatic forces. On the other hand, vacuum chucks utilize the pressure difference between the chuck and a wafer to secure the wafer during processing. They create a vacuum seal to establish a firm grip. Both types are essential in semiconductor manufacturing, albeit employing different principles for wafer retention.</p></p>

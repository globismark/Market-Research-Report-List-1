<p><p>End-stage renal disease (ESRD) refers to the final stage of chronic kidney disease, where the kidneys are no longer able to function well enough to sustain the body's needs. ESRD treatment typically involves dialysis or kidney transplantation. Dialysis uses a machine to filter waste and excess fluids from the blood, while transplantation involves replacing the damaged kidneys with a healthy one.</p><p>The global end-stage renal disease treatment market is expected to witness steady growth in the coming years. This can be attributed to various factors, such as the growing prevalence of chronic kidney diseases, advancements in dialysis techniques, increasing awareness about ESRD treatment options, and rising healthcare expenditure.</p><p>The market is also driven by the rising number of patients requiring dialysis or kidney transplantation due to an aging population and the prevalence of diabetes and hypertension. Technological advancements, such as the development of wearable dialysis devices and portable dialysis machines, are further contributing to market growth.</p><p>In terms of trends, there is a shift towards home-based dialysis treatment, as it offers convenience and better quality of life for patients. Home dialysis allows patients to perform treatments at their own pace and reduces their dependency on healthcare facilities. Additionally, there is a growing focus on the development of implantable artificial kidneys, which hold the potential to revolutionize ESRD treatment by eliminating the need for dialysis or transplantation.</p><p>Overall, the end-stage renal disease treatment market is expected to witness significant growth in the coming years, driven by technological advancements, increasing prevalence of kidney diseases, and shifting treatment paradigms towards home-based dialysis. The market is projected to grow at a CAGR of 4.8% during the forecast period.</p></p>

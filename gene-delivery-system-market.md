<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Gene Delivery System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Viral Gene Delivery System</li><li>Non-viral Gene Delivery System</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The gene delivery system market comprises two main types: viral gene delivery system and non-viral gene delivery system. Viral gene delivery system involves using modified viruses to deliver therapeutic genes into target cells. This method has high efficiency but presents potential safety concerns. On the other hand, non-viral gene delivery system employs various carriers such as lipids, polymers, and nanoparticles to transport genes into cells. This method is safer, but generally exhibits lower efficiency. Both types play a crucial role in gene therapy, offering different advantages and limitations for introducing therapeutic genes into the body.</p></p>

<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Smartphone Audio Codecs Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Lossless Compression</li><li>Lossy Compression</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The smartphone audio codecs market is divided into two types - lossless compression and lossy compression. Lossless compression provides high-quality audio with no compromise in sound fidelity, as it retains all the original data during compression and decompression. On the other hand, lossy compression compromises some audio data to reduce file size, resulting in slight quality loss but smaller files. Both types cater to different consumer preferences, with lossless codecs favored by audiophiles and lossy codecs preferred by those who prioritize file size and storage efficiency.</p></p>

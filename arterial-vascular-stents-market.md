<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Arterial Vascular Stents Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Self Expansion</li><li>Balloon Dilatation</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Arterial vascular stents are used in medical procedures to treat blockages or narrowings in arteries. There are two main types: self-expansion stents and balloon dilatation stents. Self-expansion stents are made of a special material that allows them to expand on their own and hold the artery open. Balloon dilatation stents, on the other hand, use a balloon catheter to expand the stent and open up the blocked artery. Both types of stents aim to restore blood flow in the affected artery and improve overall cardiovascular health.</p></p>

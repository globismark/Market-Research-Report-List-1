<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Commercial Generator Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Diesel Generator</li><li>Natural Gas Generator</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The commercial generator market is divided into two main types: diesel generators and natural gas generators. Diesel generators use diesel fuel to run an engine, which then converts mechanical energy into electrical energy. These generators are known for their reliability, durability, and high energy conversion efficiency. On the other hand, natural gas generators use natural gas as a fuel source. They offer lower emissions compared to diesel generators and are considered more environmentally friendly. Natural gas generators are commonly used in areas with easy access to natural gas pipelines.</p></p>

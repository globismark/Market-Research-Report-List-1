<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Premium Absinthe Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Distillation</li><li>Cold Mixing</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>In the premium absinthe market, two common types are distillation and cold mixing. Distillation involves the traditional process of refining absinthe through distilleries, which separates the spirit from its ingredients, resulting in a more fine and complex flavor profile. On the other hand, cold mixing is a modern method where pre-distilled spirits are blended together with herbs and botanicals without undergoing a distillation process. This allows for a quicker and less intensive production method, but may result in a simpler and less nuanced taste compared to distillation.</p></p>

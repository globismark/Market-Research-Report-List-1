<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Light Mining Dump Truck Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Articulated Trucks</li><li>Rigid Trucks</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Light mining dump trucks can be classified into two main types: articulated trucks and rigid trucks. Articulated trucks consist of two sections connected by a pivot joint, which allows for better maneuverability in tight spaces and rough terrains. These trucks are suitable for operating in narrow mine tunnels or on uneven surfaces. On the other hand, rigid trucks have a solid frame and are more robust, offering higher load capacity. They are commonly used for transporting heavy materials over long distances in open-pit mines or large-scale mining operations.</p></p>

<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Rotary Kiln Type Incinerators Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Counter Current Rotary Kiln Incinerators</li><li>Co-Current Rotary Kiln Incinerators</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Rotary kiln type incinerators are used for waste disposal by thermal treatment. Counter current rotary kiln incinerators involve feeding waste into one end of the kiln, where it moves in the opposite direction of the hot gases produced by the combustion process. This helps to maximize the combustion efficiency and reduce the emission of pollutants. Co-current rotary kiln incinerators, on the other hand, involve feeding waste and hot gases into the kiln in the same direction. This method is advantageous for types of waste that require longer residence time at higher temperatures.</p></p>

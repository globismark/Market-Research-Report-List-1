<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Gas Lift Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Continuous Flow</li><li>Intermittent Flow</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Gas lift is a method used in the oil and gas industry to increase production from wells by injecting gas into the wellbore. There are two main types of gas lift market: continuous flow and intermittent flow. In continuous flow gas lift, gas is continuously injected into the well, creating a lifted production stream. On the other hand, intermittent flow gas lift involves injecting gas in a cyclical manner, with well shut-ins in between injections. Both methods aim to optimize production rates and enhance the recovery of oil and gas from wells.</p></p>

<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The CPAP Ventilators Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Fixed-CPAP</li><li>Auto CPAP</li></ul></p>
<p><p>CPAP (Continuous Positive Airway Pressure) ventilators are widely used for treating obstructive sleep apnea and other respiratory conditions. Fixed-CPAP machines deliver a constant pressure of air throughout the night to keep the airways open. On the other hand, Auto CPAP machines adjust the air pressure automatically based on the individual's needs, providing a customized treatment that adapts to changes in breathing patterns. Both types of CPAP ventilators are effective in maintaining a continuous flow of air, but Auto CPAP offers added flexibility and comfort for patients.</p></p>

<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Precision Investment Castings Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Sodium Silicate Process</li><li>Tetraethyl Orthosilicate/ Silica Sol Process</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Precision investment castings market types include the Sodium Silicate Process and the Tetraethyl Orthosilicate/Silica Sol Process. In the Sodium Silicate Process, a water-based sodium silicate binder is mixed with refractory material to form a slurry that is coated onto ceramic shells. Once dried, the shells are heated, causing the binder to harden and creating a mold for the casting. The Tetraethyl Orthosilicate/Silica Sol Process involves mixing tetraethyl orthosilicate with silica sol to create a ceramic slurry that is then coated onto wax patterns. The slurry is hardened, and the wax is melted and removed, leaving a ceramic mold for casting.</p></p>

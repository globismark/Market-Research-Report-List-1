<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Torque Angle Sensors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Contact Type</li><li>Non-contact Type</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Torque angle sensors are devices used to measure the torque and angle of rotation in mechanical systems. The market for these sensors can be categorized into two types: contact and non-contact. Contact type torque angle sensors rely on physical contact between the sensing element and the rotating shaft to measure torque and angle. They offer accurate readings but can lead to wear and tear. On the other hand, non-contact type sensors employ technologies like magnetics or optics to measure torque and angle without physical contact, resulting in minimal wear and longer lifespan.</p></p>

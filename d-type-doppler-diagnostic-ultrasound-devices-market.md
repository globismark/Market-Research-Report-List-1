<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The D-type Doppler Diagnostic Ultrasound Devices Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>CW</li><li>PW</li></ul></p>
<p><p>D-type Doppler Diagnostic Ultrasound Devices are used in medical imaging to assess blood flow and detect abnormalities. There are two types: Continuous Wave (CW) Doppler and Pulse Wave (PW) Doppler. CW Doppler uses a continuous stream of sound waves to measure blood flow velocity but cannot accurately determine the depth of the source. PW Doppler emits short bursts of sound waves to analyze blood flow velocity and direction at specific locations in the body. This allows for more precise measurements but covers a smaller area compared to CW Doppler. Both methods aid in diagnosing various medical conditions.</p></p>

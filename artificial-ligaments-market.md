<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Artificial Ligaments Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Synthetic Artificial Ligament</li><li>Biological Artificial Ligament</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The artificial ligaments market consists of two main types: synthetic artificial ligament and biological artificial ligament. Synthetic artificial ligament is made from man-made materials, such as polymers, and is designed to mimic the function and structure of natural ligaments. On the other hand, biological artificial ligament is derived from living tissues, such as tendons from human or animal sources, and is processed to remove cellular components. Both types aim to provide stability and strength to damaged or injured ligaments, enabling patients to restore normal joint function and mobility.</p></p>

<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Cotton Harvester Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Stripper Type</li><li>Spindle Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Cotton harvester market types consist of two main categories: stripper type and spindle type. Stripper type harvesters remove the entire cotton boll, including leaves and stems, using rotating stripping bars. This method is suitable for slightly mature cotton. On the other hand, spindle type harvesters utilize spindles with spiky disks to pick the cotton gently from the plants. This method is preferred for mature cotton as it allows selective harvesting, leaving behind unripe bolls for future picking. The choice between the two types depends on the maturity level of the cotton crop.</p></p>

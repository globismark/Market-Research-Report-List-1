<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Brachytherapy Devices Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>High Dose Rate Brachytherapy</li><li>Low Dose Rate Brachytherapy</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Brachytherapy devices are used in the treatment of different types of cancer. High-dose rate brachytherapy (HDR) involves delivering a high dose of radiation over a short period, typically a few minutes, using a remote-controlled afterloader device. Low-dose rate brachytherapy (LDR) delivers radiation at a lower dose rate, typically over several hours or days. HDR offers precise targeting and reduced outpatient visits, while LDR provides continuous, long-term radiation delivery. Both types have their benefits and are used based on the specific needs of the patient and type of cancer being treated.</p></p>

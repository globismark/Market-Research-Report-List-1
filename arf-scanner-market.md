<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The ArF Scanner Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>ArF Immersion Scanner</li><li>Dry ArF Scanner</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>ArF scanners are advanced lithography machines used in semiconductor manufacturing. ArF Immersion Scanner utilizes a liquid medium, usually water, between the lens and the wafer to enhance resolution and reduce wavelength limitations. This allows for more precise circuit patterns. On the other hand, Dry ArF Scanner does not use a liquid medium, but relies on high numerical aperture lenses and multiple patterning techniques to achieve similar results. Both market types cater to the increasing demands of smaller and more complex microchip designs in the semiconductor industry.</p></p>

<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Ventilation Boxes Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Active</li><li>Passive</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Ventilation boxes are a key component of ventilation systems used in various industries. Active ventilation boxes are equipped with fans or blowers that actively extract stale air and introduce fresh air into an environment. They are suitable for spaces with higher air contamination. On the other hand, passive ventilation boxes rely on natural air movement, such as wind and temperature differences, to circulate air. They are more appropriate for areas with lower air contamination. Both types of ventilation boxes improve indoor air quality, but in different ways based on the degree of air movement they facilitate.</p></p>

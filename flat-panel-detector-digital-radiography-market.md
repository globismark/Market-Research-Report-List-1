<p><p>Flat Panel Detector (FPD) Digital Radiography is a modern imaging technology used in medical and industrial fields. It is divided into two types - Indirect FPD and Direct FPD. Indirect FPD uses a scintillator to convert X-ray photons into light, which is then detected by an array of photodiodes. This direct conversion process offers excellent image quality and high detector efficiency. Meanwhile, Direct FPD directly converts X-ray photons into electric charge, eliminating the need for a scintillator. This type offers improved image contrast and spatial resolution, making it suitable for high-demand applications.</p></p>

<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Full Body X-ray Scanner Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Backscatter X-ray Scanner</li><li>Through-body X-ray Scanner</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Full Body X-ray Scanner Market Types include backscatter X-ray scanners and through-body X-ray scanners. Backscatter X-ray scanners use low-intensity X-ray beams that bounce off the skin's surface to create an image of the body's external features. Through-body X-ray scanners, on the other hand, use higher-intensity X-ray beams that can penetrate through the body to create a more detailed image of the internal organs and structures. Both types of scanners are used in various security or medical applications, with backscatter scanners being more commonly used in airport security and through-body scanners in medical diagnostics.</p></p>

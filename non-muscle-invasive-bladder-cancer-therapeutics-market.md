<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Non-muscle Invasive Bladder Cancer Therapeutics Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Intravesical Chemotherapy</li><li>Intravesical Immunotherapy</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Non-muscle invasive bladder cancer therapeutics refer to treatments that are specifically designed to target bladder cancer within the inner layers of the bladder without invading the surrounding muscle tissue. Intravesical chemotherapy involves the direct instillation of drugs into the bladder through a catheter to kill cancer cells. Intravesical immunotherapy, on the other hand, uses substances to stimulate the body's immune system and help it recognize and destroy cancer cells. Both treatment types aim to prevent the progression or recurrence of bladder cancer while minimizing systemic side effects.</p></p>
